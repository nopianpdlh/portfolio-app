## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Form Handling:
```typescript
- react-hook-form for form state management
- @hookform/resolvers/zod for validation
- Client-side validation before submission
- Server-side validation in actions
- Toast notifications for success/error
```

### Data Flow:
```
1. User fills form
2. Client-side validation (Zod)
3. Submit to server action
4. Server-side validation (Zod)
5. Database operation (Prisma)
6. Cache revalidation
7. Toast notification
8. Redirect to list page
```

### Date Handling:
```typescript
// Form to Server (string to Date)
issueDate: data.issueDate ? new Date(data.issueDate) : null

// Server to Form (Date to string)
issueDate: cert.issueDate 
  ? new Date(cert.issueDate).toISOString().split("T")[0] 
  : undefined
```

### Conditional Logic:
```typescript
// Disable end date if currently studying
<Input
  id="endDate"
  type="date"
  {...register("endDate")}
  disabled={isCurrent}  // ← Reactive
/>

// Auto-clear end date when toggling "Current"
watch("isCurrent") // Watches for changes
```
