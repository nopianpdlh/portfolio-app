- âœ… Toggle Featured: "Featured status updated!"
- âœ… Toggle Published: "Publish status updated!"

## Usage Pattern

All implementations follow the same pattern:

```typescript
import { toast } from "sonner"

try {
  await someAction()
  toast.success("Action completed successfully!")
  router.refresh()
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error)
  toast.error("Failed to perform action. Please try again.")
}
```

## Toast Types

1. **Success** (Green): `toast.success("Message")`
   - Create operations
   - Update operations
   - Delete operations
   - Reorder operations

2. **Error** (Red): `toast.error("Message")`
   - Any failed operation
   - Validation errors
   - Server errors

## Benefits

âœ… **Better UX**: Visual feedback for all actions
âœ… **Consistency**: Same notification style across all features
âœ… **Rich Colors**: Green for success, red for errors
âœ… **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after a few seconds
âœ… **Non-blocking**: Users can continue working while toast is visible
âœ… **Accessible**: Screen reader friendly
âœ… **Modern**: Follows current web design trends

## Testing

Test each feature:
1. **Projects**: Create, edit, delete, toggle featured/published/archived
2. **Skills**: Add, edit (inline), delete, drag-drop reorder
3. **Experiences**: Create, edit, delete, drag-drop reorder
4. **Settings**: Update site information

Expected: Toast notification appears for every action (success or error)

## Future Enhancements

When implementing Blog Management and Contacts Inbox:
- Use the same pattern for consistency
- Import `toast` from "sonner"
- Add success/error notifications for all CRUD operations
- Consider adding `toast.loading()` for long-running operations
- Can add `toast.promise()` for automatic loading â†’ success/error states

## Status

âœ… **Completed**: All existing admin features now have toast notifications
ðŸ”„ **Pending**: Blog Management and Contacts Inbox (when implemented)
